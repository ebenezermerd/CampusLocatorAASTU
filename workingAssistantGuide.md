**High Level App Analysis and Operational Guide**

**1. App Structure and Pages:**
   
   - **Home Page:**
     - This is the first page users see when they open the app. It should have a clean design with a search bar at the top for building numbers or names, and a list or grid view of buildings below. Each building should have a small image and a brief description. There should also be a section for upcoming events.
  
   - **Building Detail Page:**
     - When a user clicks on a building, they are taken to this page. It should display detailed information about the building, including its purpose, operating hours, and available amenities. There should also be a button for getting directions to the building.

   - **Directions Page:**
     - This page should provide step-by-step directions from the user's current location to the selected building. It could use a map view for visual guidance.

   - **Events Page:**
     - This page should display a calendar of campus events. When a user clicks on an event, they should see more details about it, including where it will take place. There should also be an option to get directions to the event location.

   - **Settings Page:**
     - This page should allow users to customize their app experience, such as changing their location settings.

**2. Database Structure:**

   - **Buildings Collection:**
     - This collection should store documents where each document represents a building. Each document should have fields for the building number, name, image, description, purpose, operating hours, and amenities.

   - **Events Collection:**
     - This collection should store documents where each document represents an event. Each document should have fields for the event name, date, time, location (building number), and description.

**3. Operation Plan:**

   - **Phase 1 - Design:**
     - Sketch the app's user interface based on the structure outlined above. Use a tool like Adobe XD or Figma.

   - **Phase 2 - Development:**
     - Start developing the app using Flutter. Begin with the basic navigation between pages, then implement each page one by one, starting with the Home Page.

   - **Phase 3 - Integration:**
     - Integrate the app with Firebase. Set up the database collections and write the necessary queries for fetching building and event data.

   - **Phase 4 - Testing:**
     - Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features are working as expected. Fix any bugs that are found.

   - **Phase 5 - Deployment:**
     - Deploy the app to the Google Play Store and/or Apple App Store.

**API and Resources in Use for Development**

1. **Google Maps API:**
   - Display maps, place markers for each building, and provide step-by-step directions.

2. **Firebase API:**
   - Real-time database, user authentication, analytics, and other features.

3. **Google Places API:**
   - Provide additional information about places, such as reviews and photos.

4. **Google Calendar API:**
   - Integrate with Google Calendar for events. Provides Dart client libraries for accessing Google APIs, including Google Calendar.
