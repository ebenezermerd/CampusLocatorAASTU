High level App Analysis and Operational Guide
````````````````````````````````````
1. App Structure and Pages:

    - Home Page: This is the first page users see when they open the app. It should have a clean design with a search bar at the top for building numbers or names, and a list or grid view of buildings below. Each building should have a small image and a brief description. There should also be a section for upcoming events.

    - Building Detail Page: When a user clicks on a building, they are taken to this page. It should display detailed information about the building, including its purpose, operating hours, and available amenities. There should also be a button for getting directions to the building.

    - Directions Page: This page should provide step-by-step directions from the user's current location to the selected building. It could use a map view for visual guidance.

    - Events Page: This page should display a calendar of campus events. When a user clicks on an event, they should see more details about it, including where it will take place. There should also be an option to get directions to the event location.

    - Settings Page: This page should allow users to customize their app experience, such as changing their location settings.

2. **Database Structure:**

    - **Buildings Collection:** This collection should store documents where each document represents a building. Each document should have fields for the building number, name, image, description, purpose, operating hours, and amenities.

    - **Events Collection:** This collection should store documents where each document represents an event. Each document should have fields for the event name, date, time, location (building number), and description.

3. **Operation Plan:**

    - **Phase 1 - Design:** Sketch the app's user interface based on the structure outlined above. Use a tool like Adobe XD or Figma.

    - **Phase 2 - Development:** Start developing the app using Flutter. Begin with the basic navigation between pages, then implement each page one by one, starting with the Home Page.

    - **Phase 3 - Integration:** Integrate the app with Firebase. Set up the database collections and write the necessary queries for fetching building and event data.

    - **Phase 4 - Testing:** Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features are working as expected. Fix any bugs that are found.

    - **Phase 5 - Deployment:** Deploy the app to the Google Play Store and/or Apple App Store.

API and resources in use for development
`````````````````````````````````````````
For building a campus locator app, we'll need to use a few APIs and resources. Here are some that might be useful:

1. **Google Maps API:** This is the most important API for your app. You can use it to display maps, place markers for each building, and provide step-by-step directions. Google Maps API is free up to a certain usage limit.

2. **Firebase API:** Firebase provides a real-time database, user authentication, analytics, and many other features. It has a generous free tier that should be sufficient for your app.

3. **Google Places API:** This API can provide additional information about places, such as reviews and photos. It's free up to a certain usage limit.

4. **Google Calendar API:** If you want to integrate with Google Calendar for the events feature, you can use this API. It's also free up to a certain usage limit.

For precise location and efficient movement, you can use the Geolocation and Geocoding features of the Google Maps API. Geolocation allows you to get the user's current location, and Geocoding allows you to convert between addresses and geographic coordinates.

So, for flutter we will use packages like:
* Google Maps API: You can use the google_maps_flutter package. This package provides Flutter widgets that wrap the underlying Google Maps Android and iOS SDKs.
* Firebase API: The firebase_core package is the entry point for all Flutter Firebase plugins. For the Firebase Realtime Database, you can use the firebase_database package. For Firebase Authentication, you can use the firebase_auth package.
* Google Places API: The flutter_google_places package provides autocomplete support for user searches.
* Google Calendar API: There isn't a dedicated Flutter package for this API, but you can use the googleapis package, which provides Dart client libraries for accessing Google APIs, including Google Calendar.

Description for the above structure
```````````````````````````````````
lib: This is where all your Dart code goes.
main.dart: This is the entry point of your app. It should call runApp() with your App widget.
app.dart: This file defines your App widget, which includes your app's theme and routes.
routes.dart: This file defines all the routes in your app.
theme.dart: This file defines your app's theme.
models: This directory contains all your data models, like Building and Event.
views: This directory contains all your pages.
widgets: This directory contains reusable widgets that can be used across different pages.
services: This directory contains services that interact with APIs or perform complex logic.
test: This is where all your test code goes. It mirrors the structure of the lib directory.
assets: This is where your images, fonts, and other assets go.
pubspec.yaml: This file defines your app's dependencies and includes a section for specifying your assets.
